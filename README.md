Sample FileMaker file with __One Of Everything__ (Ooe)

Ooe.fmp12 endeavors to have an example of one of every possible configuration of every kind of solution element.

- At least one table, field, layout, layout object, script, script step, value list, etc.
- For each kind of item, all variants, e.g. for layout objects: slide control, web viewer, button, etc.
- For each variant, all configuration permutations, e.g., a Send Mail script step that uses the default email client and another that sends via SMTP.

Achieving 100% coverage is not a realistic goal, but the hope is that over time we can accumulate examples of all of the different possible permutations to this file.

Among other possible use cases, having these examples available makes it easier to explore the FileMaker Save-as-XML (SaXML) format.

- The saxml folder contains SaXML files generated using FileMaker clients from all versions since SaXML was first released.
- Because generating these files is a manual process (time consuming) for the older versions (pre-FMDeveloperTool), these SaXML files won't always reflect the most recent Ooe.fmp12 file. In other words, the Ooe.fmp12 might get updated without also updating the xml files. So make sure to check which commit when each SaXML file was last updated.
