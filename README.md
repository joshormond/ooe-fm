Sample FileMaker file with __One Of Everything__ (Ooe)

Ooe.fmp12 endeavors to have an example of one of every possible configuration of every kind of solution element.

- At least one table, field, layout, layout object, script, script step, value list, etc.
- For each kind of item, all variants, e.g. for layout objects: slide control, web viewer, button, etc.
- For each variant, all configuration permutations, e.g., a Send Mail script step that uses the default email client and another that sends via SMTP.

Achieving 100% coverage is not a realistic goal, but the hope is that over time we can accumulate examples of all of the different possible permutations to this file.

Among other possible use cases, having these examples available makes it easier to explore the FileMaker Save-as-XML (SaXML) format.
